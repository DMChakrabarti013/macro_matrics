# macro_matricsBelow is a comprehensive “blueprint” for implementing a robust G‐selection framework that builds on your original idea but now leverages several advanced methods. In our framework, we want to produce a composite similarity score (or “G‐score”) for each state using multiple lenses. In our case, we incorporate the following methods:

PCA for Dimensionality Reduction:
To “whiten” or reduce your baseline variables so that correlated predictors don’t unduly influence distance measures.

K-Means with Mahalanobis-like Distance:
By performing PCA with whitening, then running k-means clustering on the transformed data you effectively use a distance that is similar in spirit to the Mahalanobis distance.

Adaptive LASSO Regression:
Use a two-stage weighted LASSO approach to predict pre‑treatment GDP; the predicted values (or the coefficients) serve as a score reflecting which baseline features matter most.

Decision Tree Regression:
Fit a regression tree to predict pre‑treatment GDP and use the tree’s predicted value (or alternatively, the leaf-node identifier) as a grouping signal.

Random Forest Proximity:
Fit a random forest to predict pre‑treatment GDP and compute a proximity matrix that indicates how often states “end up” in the same leaves. This becomes another similarity measure.

XGBoost-Based Similarity Score:
Use XGBoost (a boosted tree model) to predict pre‑treatment GDP and either use its predictions as a score or extract the leaf indices (and derive a proximity measure).
