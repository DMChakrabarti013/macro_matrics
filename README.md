# macro_matricsBelow is a comprehensive “blueprint” for implementing a robust G‐selection framework that builds on your original idea but now leverages several advanced methods. In our framework, we want to produce a composite similarity score (or “G‐score”) for each state using multiple lenses. In our case, we incorporate the following methods:

PCA for Dimensionality Reduction:
To “whiten” or reduce your baseline variables so that correlated predictors don’t unduly influence distance measures.

K-Means with Mahalanobis-like Distance:
By performing PCA with whitening, then running k-means clustering on the transformed data you effectively use a distance that is similar in spirit to the Mahalanobis distance.

Adaptive LASSO Regression:
Use a two-stage weighted LASSO approach to predict pre‑treatment GDP; the predicted values (or the coefficients) serve as a score reflecting which baseline features matter most.

Decision Tree Regression:
Fit a regression tree to predict pre‑treatment GDP and use the tree’s predicted value (or alternatively, the leaf-node identifier) as a grouping signal.

Random Forest Proximity:
Fit a random forest to predict pre‑treatment GDP and compute a proximity matrix that indicates how often states “end up” in the same leaves. This becomes another similarity measure.

XGBoost-Based Similarity Score:
Use XGBoost (a boosted tree model) to predict pre‑treatment GDP and either use its predictions as a score or extract the leaf indices (and derive a proximity measure).

Summary of the Enhanced G‑Selection Framework
Preprocessing & Dimensionality Reduction:

Clean and preprocess baseline variables.

Use PCA to reduce dimensions (optional but recommended).

Individual ML Methods:

K-Means (with PCA whitening): Clusters states, scoring by distance to centroid.

Adaptive LASSO: Uses baseline variables to predict pre‑treatment GDP; predicted values serve as a score.

Decision Tree: Produces clear groupings via splits; predictions form a score.

Mahalanobis Matching (or as part of K-means via PCA whitening): Captures correlated distances.

Random Forest Proximity: Uses leaf co-occurrence to compute similarity.

XGBoost: Provides robust predictions and can offer a proximity signal.

Ensemble of G-Scores:

Normalize and combine the scores using weighted averaging.

This composite score defines, for each state, how similar it is to a treated state.

Control (G) Selection:

For each treated state, select the top donors (based on the composite G-score) as the candidate control group.

Integration with Dynamic Matching:

In parallel, use dynamic features (e.g., VAR coefficients and IRF) to inform matching of pre-treatment trajectories.

An iterative alpha-grid search can be performed where for each alpha the synthetic control predictions are computed; the optimal alpha minimizes the pre-treatment MSE between observed and synthetic outcomes.
